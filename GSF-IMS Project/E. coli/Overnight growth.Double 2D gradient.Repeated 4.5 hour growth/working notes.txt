

Move sequence assignments within Abgene plates and dynamically assign pipetting sequences to accomodate multiple plate preps from a single Abgene plate

Add simple/uniform/non-selective plate prep method

Add plate and lid movement to Double gradient method

Add plate and lid movement to Non-selective plate prep method

Add buzzer/shaker to 96-head eject method

Modify Double 2D gradient method to leave new Growth Plate on handoff, and to throw Old Growth Plate to waste

Add culture volume variable with user selection

Rename "Uniform non-selective plate prep" -> "Uniform non-selective plate prep plus starting bacteria"; then make new method "Uniform non-selective plate prep" to prep plate without adding bacteria

Change parameter name used to keep track of how many gradient plates were made: "plateNum" -> "gradPlateNum"

Add keepOldPlate/keep_old_plate parameter;
keepOldPlate is a variable passed to Hamilton Venus; used in the "Dilute-copy plate with 96-head" method, to indicate if the old growth plate is kept (keepOldPlate == true) or thrown to waste (keepOldPlate != true)

New method to move old growth plate to handoff position (to be put back in reader)

Reagent plate to EasyPick; Reagent plate lid parking to current spot where reagent plate is

Only initialize Overlord hardware once


Remove empty tip racks after putting GP in Epoch - add clearWasteRack variable in Tips procedure

Move tip hotel prompt to before StartXML

Prompt to make sure STAR in not in simulatoon mode BEFORE edit tip counters

Take out User prompts for "running X hour read..." and add in Timers.

If AbortCalled, stop trying to send TCP message.
Also, need to check connection before sending, otherwise it goes into an endless loop - or automatically recconect if sending message fails N times.

Are you sure you want to abort?

No Hamilton method filename attached to XML for ReadCounters

Make sure user prompts are always on top


TODO:

Run lid movement check Venus method with user prompts before starting run


Tip requirements for Offset tips - 

Automatically write to tip status file after add tip methods in Venus

EPOCHXGP slow down movements a bit?



Find good source of universal sterile lids

Manually count Growth Plates from stack (stack inventory procedure doesn't work reliably)

Add sequence definitions for different plate numbers and for different bacteria

Check mixing in all methods
