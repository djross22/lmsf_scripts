

Move sequence assignments within Abgene plates and dynamically assign pipetting sequences to accomodate multiple plate preps from a single Abgene plate

Add simple/uniform/non-selective plate prep method

Add plate and lid movement to Double gradient method

Add plate and lid movement to Non-selective plate prep method

Add buzzer/shaker to 96-head eject method

Modify Double 2D gradient method to leave new Growth Plate on handoff, and to throw Old Growth Plate to waste

Add culture volume variable with user selection

Rename "Uniform non-selective plate prep" -> "Uniform non-selective plate prep plus starting bacteria"; then make new method "Uniform non-selective plate prep" to prep plate without adding bacteria

Change parameter name used to keep track of how many gradient plates were made: "plateNum" -> "gradPlateNum"

Add keepOldPlate/keep_old_plate parameter;
keepOldPlate is a variable passed to Hamilton Venus; used in the "Dilute-copy plate with 96-head" method, to indicate if the old growth plate is kept (keepOldPlate == true) or thrown to waste (keepOldPlate != true)

New method to move old growth plate to handoff position (to be put back in reader)

TODO:

Manually count Growth Plates from stack (stack inventory procedure doesn't work reliably)

Reagent plate to EasyPick; Reagent plate lid parking to current spot where reagent plate is

Only initialize Overlord hardware once


Add sequence definitions for different plate numbers and for different bacteria

Check mixing in all methods

Check LLD settings for new labware
